Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5075}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {6052}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Great start, did forget the possibility for "twone" or "fiveight" to appear for the 2nd part

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4592}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {10519}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took a bit more time for p2 because of a misunderstanding, easy otherwise

## Day 3: Gear Ratios
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 3015}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1651}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Hard for a day 3, took a long time getting the first part, and the second one was much more easier with a structure for symbols

## Day 4: Scratchcards
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 3447}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {4624}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**:  Hard part is the parsing, otherwise, it was alright

## Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 6979}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1703}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Really hard for a day 5, naÃ¯ve idea doesn't work (or maybe does, after a really long time). Had to create a structure for intervals and transformation

## Day 6: Wait For It
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5635}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {5661}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Easy day, sad I woke up a bit late

## Day 7: Camel Cards
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1497}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {596}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Still easier than day 5, took too much time to implement the first part, the second part was more easy when I decided to create a custom comparator.

## Day 8: Haunted Wasteland
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 6722}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3368}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Really upset that ppcm is working for Part2 since the prompt is not precise enough, happy I checked the input when I was stuck.

## Day 9: Mirage Maintenance
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4689}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3861}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Easier day, relieved after the previous day

## Day 10: Pipe Maze
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4320}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1028}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took too much time to implement Part1, Part2 seemed difficult but analyzing carefully the ex (and having solved some previous similar problem), I did Part2 quite efficiently. 

## Day 11: Cosmic Expansion
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2517}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1765}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Part1 and Part2 were easy, little time debugging a small error when adding lines (were adding one extra line/col so the difference wasn't right for every galaxy) 

## Day 12: Hot Springs
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1514}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {819}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Harder than the previous ones, but with a bit of dynamic programming, it was okay.

## Day 13: Point of Incidence
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1792}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {2306}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Part1 was easy, Part2 made me think a bit more to find a fast solution. Checking for one error only in the mirror was the solution I found.

## Day 14: Point of Incidence
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2322}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1262}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took a bit of time to find the period of the cycle, but had the right idea.

## Day 15: Lens Library
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5718}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3185}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Harder to understand than to implement!

## Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1246}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1411}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Did really good on that one, thought they wanted us to count the number of times we touch each mirror for Part2, but no.

## Day 17: Clumsy Crucible
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 891}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1004}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Sir Dijkstra promised the smallest path, not the fastest computing...

## Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1671}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {472}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: My best score so far, i did the Part2 with a custom hex to decimal converter, since I don't know if it exists in Go

## Day 19: Aplenty
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1875}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {525}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: I used Dynamid Programmation to count all the possibilities and keep the previous calculations in mind

## Day 20: Pulse Propagation
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1144}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {685}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Learned my lesson with day8, used PPCM way earlier (but it still doesn't work in general). Parsing took ages.

## Day 21: Step Counter
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 3451}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {2566}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: End of my streak, the hardest challenge of the year. I took 1 hour to see that the input is in fact a piece of pavement, and another hour to figure that the start point is always on an empty row and an empty col (all of that while chatting with my research project manager). Then, I understood that we can decompose any position by X*Dimension of input + offset (with a little discord help) depending of where it heads to. Took me 5hours in total, but i'm very proud of it.

## Day 22: Sand Slabs
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2210}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {2079}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Still a bit difficult for me, i misunderstood the problem at first (swapped Y and Z axis). Then i managed to find a solution that was nearly the answer for both parts, by calculing the number of falling for each brick i would disintegrate.

## Day 23 A Long Walk: 
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2554}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1146}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: I did a bit better this time: my solution for Part1 was again nearly solution for my Part2, but i broke my code a few time before succeeding. I use a DFS algorithm in a graph containing only the intersection.

## Day 24 Never Tell Me The Odds: 
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2215}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {958}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Used Z3 package in python to be efficient. Then proceeded to lose 2 hours trying to install it on windows for go, then forfeited and found another solution in 3 hours. I make a linear problem which I solve using Gaussian Elimination

## Day 25 Snowverload:
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 734}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {631}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Last problem, i was efficient: Considering a source node , I used 4 BFS for other each node: 3 first to cut the paths with the source, 4th to try to reach the source: If its possible, they are in the same group, if not, there aren't in the same group.
