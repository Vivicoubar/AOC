Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5075}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {6052}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Great start, did forget the possibility for "twone" or "fiveight" to appear for the 2nd part

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4592}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {10519}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took a bit more time for p2 because of a misunderstanding, easy otherwise

## Day 3: Gear Ratios
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 3015}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1651}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Hard for a day 3, took a long time getting the first part, and the second one was much more easier with a structure for symbols

## Day 4: Scratchcards
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 3447}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {4624}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**:  Hard part is the parsing, otherwise, it was alright

## Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 6979}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1703}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Really hard for a day 5, naÃ¯ve idea doesn't work (or maybe does, after a really long time). Had to create a structure for intervals and transformation

## Day 6: Wait For It
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5635}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {5661}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Easy day, sad I woke up a bit late

## Day 7: Camel Cards
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1497}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {596}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Still easier than day 5, took too much time to implement the first part, the second part was more easy when I decided to create a custom comparator.

## Day 8: Haunted Wasteland
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 6722}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3368}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Really upset that ppcm is working for Part2 since the prompt is not precise enough, happy I checked the input when I was stuck.

## Day 9: Mirage Maintenance
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4689}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3861}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Easier day, relieved after the previous day

## Day 10: Pipe Maze
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 4320}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1028}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took too much time to implement Part1, Part2 seemed difficult but analyzing carefully the ex (and having solved some previous similar problem), I did Part2 quite efficiently. 

## Day 11: Cosmic Expansion
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2517}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1765}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Part1 and Part2 were easy, little time debugging a small error when adding lines (were adding one extra line/col so the difference wasn't right for every galaxy) 

## Day 12: Hot Springs
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1514}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {819}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Harder than the previous ones, but with a bit of dynamic programming, it was okay.

## Day 13: Point of Incidence
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1792}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {2306}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Part1 was easy, Part2 made me think a bit more to find a fast solution. Checking for one error only in the mirror was the solution I found.

## Day 14: Point of Incidence
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 2322}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1262}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Took a bit of time to find the period of the cycle, but had the right idea.

## Day 15: Lens Library
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 5718}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {3185}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Harder to understand than to implement!

## Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1246}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1411}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Did really good on that one, thought they wanted us to count the number of times we touch each mirror for Part2, but no.

## Day 17: Clumsy Crucible
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 891}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {1004}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Sir Dijkstra promised the smallest path, not the fastest computing...

## Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1671}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {472}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: My best score so far, i did the Part2 with a custom hex to decimal converter, since I don't know if it exists in Go

## Day 19: Aplenty
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1875}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {525}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: I used Dynamid Programmation to count all the possibilities and keep the previous calculations in mind

## Day 20: Pulse Propagation
$$\color{black}{[}\color{blue}{* 1144}\color{black}{][}\color{gold}{**} {685}\color{black}{]}$$
**Description**: Learned my lesson with day8, used PPCM way earlier (but it still doesn't work in general). Parsing took ages.
